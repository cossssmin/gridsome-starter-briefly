Seriously, this is a static site.

You could just run `gridsome build` and then upload the entire `dist` folder to any web host.

## Deploy to Netlify 🔥

Simply connect Netlify to your GitHub repo and trigger a site rebuild every time you push to `master`.
Click this wonderful button to get started:

## Other services

For other services, such as GitLab Pages or Amazon S3, checkout the [Gridsome deploy docs](https://gridsome.org/docs/deploy-to-amazon-s3).
